# cornerstone-vuejs-poc

We are regularly asked if and how cornerstone can be used with modern javascript frameworks. This repository is to serve as very quick/dirty example of how one might accomplish an integration with [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/). It leverages the VueJs community supported [webpack starter template](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/webpack) for initial scaffolding.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [guide](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
